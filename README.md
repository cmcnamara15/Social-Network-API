This App is a exercise in using nosql & developing a solid foundational understanding in working with non relational databases. SocialCircles is a social networking web application that leverages MongoDB's performance and flexibility to provide users with an intuitive platform to share thoughts, interact with friends, and manage their friend lists. This project is built on a stack of key web technologies, including Express.js for routing, MongoDB for database management, and Mongoose ODM for handling object data modeling. The goal of the application is to mimic real-world social networking platforms in terms of functionality and data handling.
